Hey!

My name is Orhun Parmaksız. I'm living in [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey), working as a **Backend Developer** at [Charmy Co.](https://charmy.app/), and studying **Software Engineering** at [Çankaya University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87ankaya_University).

I'm also an [open source developer](https://github.com/orhun). I've {created,contributed to} many open source projects. I mostly work with **Rust**, **Go**, **C**, **Python**, and **Java**.

I'm very enthusiastic about Linux and I [maintain packages](https://archlinux.org/packages/?maintainer=orhun) for [Arch Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux) as a **Trusted User**.

Read my [manpage](https://orhun.dev/) to learn more about me.

Cheers!
